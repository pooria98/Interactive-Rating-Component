### Built with

- HTML
- SASS
- JS
- Hover and active states for numbers are also created within JavaScript

### What I learned

In order to make it more interesting, I created custom hover effects with Javascript instead of CSS.  
When you hover or click on a number, that specific number and all numbers before that will be colored.
